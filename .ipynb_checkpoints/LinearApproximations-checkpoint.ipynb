    "# LinearApproximations\n",
    "In this section, we explore the idea of approximating potentially complicated functions with a much simpler family of functions: linear functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first remind ourselves of the following version of the definition of the derivative at a point: $$f'(a)=\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In defining the derivative with a limit, what we are saying is that for $x$-values \\textit{very close} to $a$ we have: $$f'(a)\\approx\\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, we are saying we can \\textit{approximate} the value of the derivative at a point with the above expression for $x$-values \\textit{very close} to $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then rearrange the above approximation to read $$f(x)\\approx f'(a)(x-a)+f(a)$$ for $x$-values very close to $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now wait just a minute - this looks strikingly familiar. This is nothing but the equation of the tangent line to $f(x)$ at $x=a$ so let's give it a special name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $f(x)$ be differentiable at $x=a$. Then the linear approximation $L_a^f(x)$, to $f(x)$ at $x=a$ is the function $$L_a^f(x)=f'(a)(x-a)+f(a)$$ where if $f(x)$ is clear from context, we write instead $L_a(x)$."

    "The **Bisection Method** is a numerical technique used to find the roots (or zeros) of a continuous function. It leverages the **Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works in the simplest terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Guaranteed Root:** You start with an interval `[a, b]` where you know a root exists. How do you know? Because the IVT tells you that if a continuous function `f(x)` changes sign over an interval (i.e., `f(a)` and `f(b)` have opposite signs, one positive and one negative), then there *must* be at least one root within that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Find the Midpoint:** Calculate the midpoint of your current interval: `m = (a + b) / 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Check the Midpoint's Sign:**\n",
    "    * If `f(m)` is very close to zero (or exactly zero), then `m` is your root (or a very good approximation). You're done!\n",
    "    * If `f(m)` has the **same sign** as `f(a)`, it means the root must be in the right half of the interval, `[m, b]`. So, you discard the left half and make `m` your new `a`.\n",
    "    * If `f(m)` has the **same sign** as `f(b)`, it means the root must be in the left half of the interval, `[a, m]`. So, you discard the right half and make `m` your new `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Repeat:** You keep repeating steps 2 and 3. Each time, you effectively cut the interval in half, narrowing down the location of the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In essence, the Bisection Method is like playing \"hot or cold\" with a root, but you're always guaranteed to get \"warmer\" by continually halving the search space.** You continue this process until the interval is so small that the midpoint is a sufficiently accurate approximation of the root."

    "### Newton's Method (also known as Newton-Raphson Method)\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's Method is a powerful and generally fast technique for finding approximate roots of a differentiable function. Unlike the Bisection Method which relies on an interval, Newton's Method uses tangent lines to refine an initial guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Make an Initial Guess:** Start with an initial guess for the root, let's call it $x_0$. **This guess should be reasonably close to the actual root.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Draw a Tangent Line:** At the point $(x_0, f(x_0))$ on the curve of the function $f(x)$, draw the tangent line to the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Find the x-intercept of the Tangent Line:** This is the core step. The tangent line will intersect the x-axis at a new point. Let's call this new x-intercept $x_1$. This $x_1$ is our *improved* guess for the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **How to find $x_1$:**\n",
    "        * The slope of the tangent line at $x_0$ is given by the derivative $f'(x_0)$.\n",
    "        * The equation of the tangent line is $y - f(x_0) = f'(x_0)(x - x_0)$.\n",
    "        * To find the x-intercept, we set $y = 0$:\n",
    "            $0 - f(x_0) = f'(x_0)(x_1 - x_0)$\n",
    "            $-f(x_0) = f'(x_0)x_1 - f'(x_0)x_0$\n",
    "            $f'(x_0)x_1 = f'(x_0)x_0 - f(x_0)$\n",
    "            $x_1 = x_0 - \\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Repeat (Iterate):** Now, use this new, improved guess $x_1$ as your starting point for the next iteration. Draw a tangent line at $(x_1, f(x_1))$, find its x-intercept ($x_2$), and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The general iterative formula is:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Stop When Close Enough:** You repeat this process until the new guess $x_{n+1}$ is very close to the previous guess $x_n$, or when $f(x_n)$ is very close to zero. This means you've found a sufficiently accurate approximation of the root."
